## Getting Started

Too run use

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Notes on the implementation.

the OMDB api does not support year ranges, so the year range slider will limit the results currently sent back from the api and not filter the query.

I have left the code in for the api pagination and year filter to showcase what my approach would be.
