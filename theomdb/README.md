## Getting Started

Too run use

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Notes on the implementation.

the OMDB api does not support year ranges, and the page section does not work for paginating results. so the year range slider will limit the results currently send back from the api.

I have left the code in for the api pagination and year filter to showcase what my approach would be.
